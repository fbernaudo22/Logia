# Logia
An app to organize speech therapists' work.
Until now the project is composed of a navigator throught which you can open:

- Exercises, where you can search and add exercises.
- Patients, where you can add an modify patients personal section with some data.
- Home, that is the main view(not builded yet).

Data are stored and managed with CoreData, using the MVVM architecture.
